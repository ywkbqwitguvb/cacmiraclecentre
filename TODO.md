# TODO: Redesign Giving Page

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Update giving.html: Restructure hero section for more impact (add background gradient or image reference, refine text). Redesign content section with added "Why Give?" section and improved layout. Enhance donation form with better grouping, icons, and validation messages. Improve "Other Ways to Give" section with visual enhancements (e.g., icons).
- [ ] Edit css/style.css: Add new styles for redesigned hero (full-width background), improved form styling (better buttons, spacing), and responsive grid adjustments.
- [ ] Edit css/components.css: Update service-card styles for new layout, add styles for new elements like impact sections.
- [ ] Update js/main.js: Add enhanced JS for form validation feedback and any new interactions.
- [ ] Test the page: Use browser_action to launch and verify responsiveness, functionality, form submission, and QR code.
- [ ] Final verification: Ensure all changes work together and page loads correctly.
